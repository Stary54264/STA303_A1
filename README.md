### Introduction

The introduction should be about 2-3 paragraphs in length. The introduction is self-contained and tells the
reader everything they need to know to understand why this study is being conducted. This includes:

- [X] A strong/convincing argument for the importance of this study,
supported by peer-reviewed evidence (i.e. why this study is relevant to
other people).

- [X] Summaries of at least three peer-reviewed articles on the same area,
topic, or question as this study. These should concisely describe the
main conclusion/result in the context of the study sample.

- [X] The research objective, goal, or question of this study is explicitly
stated (i.e., what this study is going to do) and a strong connection is
explicitly drawn between the literature summaries and this goal (i.e.,
how does the work of others fit into this goal/study).

- [X] A brief but correct overview of the general statistical techniques that
will be employed in the paper (i.e., what types of procedures will be
used) and how these allow the research goal to be met.

### Methods

The methods section should be about 2-3 paragraphs in length and should not present any results or data
summaries. The methods section is self-contained and tells the reader what statistical procedures will be used in the study
and why these are chosen. This includes:

- [ ] Correctly mentioning what type of statistical model(s) will be
considered using appropriate course terminology.

- [ ] Correctly justifying why the statistical model(s) is/are appropriate for
the problem, with specific reference to the type of data being
considered and any other data properties that are relevant.

- [ ] Correctly explaining what predictor variables are considered of
interest to the question and why other predictors are being included in
the model.

- [ ] Correctly stating how it will be determined from the model(s) which
predictors are significant and how much variation exists in the
response.

### Results

The results section introduces the data used and highlights important attributes or characteristics of the
variables. It also walks the reader through the key steps in applying the statistical procedures mentioned in
the methods to the data with the aim of addressing the research goals. This section includes:

- [ ] Statistical summaries of the variables considered in the analysis. These
are appropriate/correct for the data being presented. Summaries
should be univariate in nature (i.e., each variable separately) but may
be supplemented by multivariate summaries if desired.

- [ ] A discussion of the statistical summaries presented, that correctly
comments on at least one of the centre, spread or shape of each
variable in the context of the sample population. Specific emphasis
should be placed on the response distribution with correct
commentary on all three of centre, spread and shape. If multivariate
summaries are also presented, the discussion should describe how the
relationship presented is relevant to the research problem.

- [ ] Presentation of the results of all statistical procedures applied to
address the research question. Estimates from models should be
presented with a corresponding measure of error/variability. Results of
hypothesis tests should include the test statistic, the corresponding
p-value and the significance level used.

- [ ] A discussion of the process involved in developing a suitable model
that addresses the research goal. When referencing multiple models,
descriptive language is used to aid the reader in distinguishing
between them (e.g. avoid labelling models as “model 1, model 2”).
Variables should be referred to conversationally and not using the
names presented in R. Statistical procedures used should be explicitly
stated, consistent with the methods section, and correctly applied.
Evidence that supports decisions made towards developing a model
that addresses the research goal must be referenced explicitly and
used correctly. The discussion should flow logically, beginning with an
initial model based on the cited literature and ending with the result
that will be interpreted in the conclusion.

### Conclusion

The conclusion section should be about 1-2 paragraphs in length and should refer to figures/tables from the
results section as needed (generally no new evidence is presented here).
The conclusion summarizes and interprets the results from the previous section and describes whether the
results are consistent with what is already known about this area. This includes:

- [ ] A formal statistical interpretation of the effect on the response of at
least one of the most important/relevant predictors in the chosen
model and should be correct and in the context of the data.

- [ ] An informal interpretation of the model results, focusing on what the
chosen model says about the relationship between predictors and
response as a whole in this project. This should be consistent with the
model results and in the context of the data.

- [ ] A comparison between the effects suggested by the model and the
effects in the literature that was summarized earlier. The comparison
should correctly address whether the effects from the model are
supported by or contradictory to the literature, with in-text citations
directing the reader to the relevant sources.

- [ ] A closing statement that highlights how the results of this study can be
used to address the stated motivation from the introduction.

## Figures, Tables, and References

Figures, tables and references provide the reader with evidence and supporting information to understand the
work described. They should be well-formatted and easy to understand, and in the case of figures and tables,
should act as standalone information that can be understood without reading the core text.
Figures, tables and references should satisfy:

- [ ] The reference list/bibliography contains all source materials or articles
mentioned in the written report. The list is well-formatted using an
appropriate format (e.g., APA). In-text citations are included whenever
information is summarized or mentioned from an external source (e.g.
peer-reviewed article) and are in a consistent format as the reference
list/bibliography.

- [ ] No R code is present in the written report (e.g. code that produces
tables/figures), and R output (as displayed in the R console) is not
present.

- [ ] Tables and figures include informative captions that cover 1) what is
presented and 2) what is the key message the reader should take
away. Captions should ensure that the reader does not need to have
read the report itself to understand what is presented in the
table/figure.

- [ ] Tables and figures are well designed (visually appealing, cohesive,
and valuable). The information presented in each table/figure is easy
to read and understand (e.g. avoids variable names from R, legible axis
labels, etc.), makes sense to be presented in a single standalone unit,
and is referenced and discussed in the main report text.
